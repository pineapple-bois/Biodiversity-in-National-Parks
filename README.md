# Biodiversity in National Parks

This is my second [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/pages/data-science-career-specializations) portfolio project.

It was an open-ended exploratory data analysis project where we would discover any patterns to the types of species that become endangered. 

----

### We were given two datasets; 

----

#### `species_info.csv` containing information on the different species in the National Parks along with their conservation status.

With columns; 

- `category` - class of animal
- `scientific_name` - the scientific name of each species
- `common_name` - the common names of each species
- `conservation_status` - each speciesâ€™ current conservation status

This dataset was an abridged version of a similar set on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity?select=species.csv)

----

#### `observations.csv`; contains information from recorded sightings of different species throughout the national parks over a seven-day period.

With columns; 

- `scientific_name` - the scientific name of each species
- `park_name` - National Park where species were found
- `observations` - the number of times each species was observed at park in the past 7 days

This dataset was entirely fictional. 
However, merging the two gave the opportunity to explore trends within `species_info.csv`

----

### Four National Parks in the United States of America were represented.

### The focus of the project was biodiversity. 
#### I decided to centre my analysis on birds of prey both protected and non-protected.

Birds of prey, also known as raptors, are considered important 'indicator species' of biodiversity. Their unique ecological role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems by controlling populations of small mammals, reptiles and other birds. 

Raptors are top predators and occupy a high trophic level, making them sensitive to changes in their prey populations and the food web. As such, changes in raptor populations can indicate shifts in ecosystem health and the presence of toxic substances, such as pesticides and heavy metals. 

Raptors have large ranges and occupy a wide variety of habitats. They require large territories and diverse habitats to survive making them effective indicators of the overall health of ecosystems. As species with a long lifespan and low reproductive rate, they are very sensitive to long-term environmental changes, such as habitat loss and degradation.
