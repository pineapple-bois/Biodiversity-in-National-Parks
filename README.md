# Biodiversity in National Parks

This is my second [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/data-analyst/tracks/dsf-portfolio-project/modules/dscp-biodiversity-in-national-parks/kanban_projects/biodiversity-in-national-parks-portfolio-project) portfolio project.

It was an open-ended exploratory data analysis project where we would discover any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. 

----

### We were given two datasets; 

----

`species_info.csv` containing information on the different species in the National Parks along with their conservation status.

With columns; 

- `category` - class of animal
- `scientific_name` - the scientific name of each species
- `common_name` - the common names of each species
- `conservation_status` - each speciesâ€™ current conservation status

### This dataset was an abridged version of a similar set on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity?select=species.csv)

----

#### `observations.csv`; contains information from recorded sightings of different species throughout the national parks in the past 7 days

With columns; 

- `scientific_name` - the scientific name of each species
- `park_name` - National Park where species were found
- `observations` - the number of times each species was observed at park in the past 7 days

### This dataset was entirely fictional. 
### However, merging the two gave the opportunity to explore trends within `species_info.csv`

----

## Four National Parks in the United States of America were represented.

The focus of the project was biodiversity. 
I decided to centre my analysis on birds of prey both protected and non-protected.
